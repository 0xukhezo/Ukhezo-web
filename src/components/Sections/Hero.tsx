        I am a Front-End Developer focused on web3 and new technologies. My professional career
        started in 2020 as a Full-Stack Developer using React and NodeJS with Express and taking a
        more microservices and front-end oriented direction. After some time working and learning
        skills like data display, redux and connecting with various APIs, I decided to focus on
        web3.

      <div className="max-w-[800px] mx-auto mt-[40px] px-10">
        After this decision, I have been a participant in several ETH Global hackathons, winning
        several of them in protocols like AAVE, Lens, Uniswap or The Graph. At the same time I
        worked at Cryptoplaza as Front-End and developed personal projects in which I expanded my
        skills.
